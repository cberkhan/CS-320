How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?\n
I ensured that my code is functional and secure by running JUnit tests and verifying the coverage for the tests was at least 80 percent. I also tried to write code that was as clean
and readable; however, I should have left comments throughout my code to make it easier for any reader to understand the functionality of the code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by focusing heavily on the requirements provided. It iis important to create a program that meets the requirements of the client and functions as it is 
intended to do so. 

How do I approach designing software?
As I stated, I focus mainly on meeting the requirements. If I do not meet the requirements provided, the code is not going to function as it is needed and will end up being useless 
to the client. I approach designing software by writing clean and readable code that meets the requirements.
